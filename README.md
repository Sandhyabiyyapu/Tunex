# ðŸŽµ Spotify Clone

This is a simple front-end clone of the Spotify Web Player built using HTML and CSS.  
It replicates the layout and design of the original Spotify interface, including a sidebar, navigation bar, content cards, and a music player footer.

This project is purely static and meant for UI practice. No backend or actual music functionality is included.
